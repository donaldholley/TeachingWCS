plc_client.py

This file is for handling logic that would be on a wcs program.  It does
not represent any of the real world objects.  This is where the decision
making happens.

    # TODO write your logic here!
    # This loop should act just like our plc_client loops in our
    # real wcs systems.  That means that you need to write decision
    # making logic here.
    # Depending on where loads are, you need to send the cranes commands
    # to pick up and place them.  There will also be situations where
    # you might want to send the cranes position commands.
