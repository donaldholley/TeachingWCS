This repositoriy simulates a simple warehouse system where loads come in on one
conveyor, are stored by the first crane, retrieved by the second crane, and
are conveyed out.

Take a look at plc_client.py and models.py.  These are the classes and
methods you should manipulate to make the cranes do what they are
supposed to do.

To run this program use `python wcs.py` or `python3 wcs.py`.  Works on Windows,
should work on any OS.
